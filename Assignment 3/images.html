    Ryomen Sukuna (Japanese: 両面 宿儺, Hepburn: Ryōmen Sukuna) is a fictional character and one of the central antagonists of the manga series Jujutsu Kaisen created by Gege Akutami. A Heian Era sorcerer, he was once known notoriously as the King of Curses and legended as the greatest Sorcerer to ever live. Although originally human, upon death, Sukuna sealed himself as a cursed object, wherein his immense power divided within 20 fingers. At the beginning of the story, Yuji Itadori ate one of his fingers, becoming his Vessel and brought Sukuna back to life.</figcaption>
